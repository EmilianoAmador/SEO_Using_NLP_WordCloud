# SEO_Using_NLP_WordCloud
In order to increase visibility of our content in search results, we need to have keywords that align with those used by users searching for our content. In this activity, I will use NLP to create a wordcloud of keywords relevant to a job title. The hypothesis is that the wordcloud will highlight the keywords used by recruiters when looking for a qualified candidate. Additionally, the more titles used the more accurate the results. (Note: that Every job posting uses the same format for listing Job titles)

Actionable Steps:
* Web Scrape data from various sites: Will be using LinkedIn, Glassdoors, and BuiltIn.
* Build NLP model using Python.
* Create a wordcloud of as many job titles used by hiring managers for a specialization. (Example: Financial Analyst should yield a variation of titles)
* Repeat previous step using a different specializaitons. (Example: Blockchain Developer/ Python Developer/ Data Scientist/ etc)
* Make a list of the top 10 key words for each specialization.
* Apply top 4 keywords to LinkedIn profile headline for two weeks and evaluate the volume of profile views per title.


Things to consider:
* Identify specializations that are more in demand and could factor in to higher volume of views by recruiters.
* Keep the same city, filters, 
* This experiment can be better tested on websites where visibility in search engines can be analyzed using Google Analytics.
